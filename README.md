Virtual-Institute Website This website is created considering the mindset of a student to make online education more interesting and informative. This website can be used by the students for attending online lectures. In this website the student can access various courses like Engineering, Law, and BBA. The student can attend various quizzes and ask doubts.The website also has other features like Login page, Admission form, About Us, Academic calender, Gallary, and live lectures. In this website we have used frontend and backend languages. This website is free, accessible to all and easy to use.

How our website works:

First a user needs to download the zip folder and then extract it. Cut and paste all the images in a new images folder and copy the styles.css file in a new CSS folder. Then you can open the home.html through live server and the website will appear.

How to use the website:

When a user opens this website, he can select any feature according to his interest like he can watch the online course lectures, can attend the quizzes, can ask any doubts by posting the doubt in the doubt clearing session, can access the academic calender to know the dates of exams and holidays, and a new student who wish to take admission can fill the admission form.

This is a team project made by Ayushman Patra, Swati Jain and Kriti Singh.
